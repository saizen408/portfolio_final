It was a sink or swim situation so <strong>I taught myself to speak Japanese</strong> without any prior knowledge. I'm a quick learner and take great pride and find enjoyment in building things that wow 🤩!<div></div>My past life in Tech sales, molded me into an <strong>exceptional communicator</strong> with a natural ability to explain complex concepts simply. I may not have professional experience as a developer...yet. HOWEVER, what I lack in experience I make up for in <strong>tenacity</strong> and the ability to <strong>learn quickly</strong> 🚀. The projects on this site and my GitHub repo (@saizen408) serve as evidence that I possess the mental aptitude to rise to any challenge you might throw my way.<div></div>I'm looking for a team that's willing to give a guy courageous enough to follow his passion a chance. If you happen to be those individuals, you'll have a teammate who is consistently <strong>one of the hardest workers</strong> on your squad and will stop at nothing to accomplish the goals before him. 😤"
